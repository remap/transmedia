TRANSMEDIA LIGHTING CONTROLLER

Data: 	 creative labor of 50 countries (distilled from over 200 - see excel tabs)
source:	 http://unctadstat.unctad.org/ReportFolders/reportFolders.aspx
info:	 http://www.unctad.org/en/Pages/DITC/CreativeEconomy/Creative-Economy-Programme.aspx

augmented with GDP data from US ERS : http://www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Macroeconomics/


HOW TO USE:


currently, all is in 'dataloop.py' - so, to run:

python ./dataloop.py

note - turn config.lighting to False to test w/o initializing networking & lighting driver


STATUS PAGE:

load html/display.html in full screen. 

The status page loads a json file every 200 ms that is written by the installation's refresh loop. (this can be changed in timer loop at top of html/js/display.js)

however, we're reading a local file, so we have to mind browser 'crossdomain' security. 

Firefox seems to work fine (We're loading a local html file, so should be fine loading local data)

yet Chrome is quite paranoid, so to use it, we much launch new chrome instance  with --disable-web-security

ie

mac:
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --disable-web-security

windows:
chrome.exe --disable-web-security



KEYBOARD CONTROL:

python ./dataloop_keyctl.py  (instead of ./dataloop.py)
and open
html/display_key.html 		(instead of html/display.html)

keys 1-9 when pressed, sets the time between years (including fade) to the key pressed.

note default is 3. 

Note key control will NOT work in firefox. we need to use the security-disabled instance of Chrome, illustrated above. 



main data params in this version:

gdpValue	= GDP
gdpPPPValue = GDP per capita
